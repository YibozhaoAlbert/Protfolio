## Website
During creating responsive website, a problem occurred. In the mobile screen size, I changed the layout of the grid from 2 column with 2 rows to 1 column 3 rows. But the setting did not override but they multiplied into 2 column with 3 rows which i have no idea where is that setting comes from. 

The mobile version did not work properly.
